# What are the Iris Species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica?

**Note** This project is mainly done on Kaggle. I have just created this repository to have a copy of it on my GirHub as well.

In this project, I work with the 'Iris' dataset, available from [UCI Machine Learning repository]((http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)). This dataset contains information about properties that differentiate species of Iris flower. There is information about length and width of its Petals and Sepals.

Let's see what each property of Iris flower is. Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers. Sepals are the usually-green part that function as protection for the flower in bud. You can read more about [Petals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petal) and [Sepals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepal) from the linked pages. It is always good to know more about your dataset as you progress with making prediction on it.
